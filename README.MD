# ToDo app

## Description
The application is a task organizer. You can now add tasks with titles and descriptions, and mark them as completed (you can undo this change). In the future I plan to split the tasks into a to-do list and a list of finished taks.

I also intend to add functionalities such as setting the duration of the task.

## Used technologies
JavaScript, React (class components, only controlled components), HTML and SCSS.

## Additional info
I am still learning and developing. I hope to improve the application over time.
